# Arduino-5110-LCD-and-Blynk-App

Trying to read the data coming from my smartphone's brightness sensor with a NodeMcu (esp8266) IoT development board using a 5110 LCD screen over the internet (wifi).ðŸ˜€ And also, I'm controlling the brightness of the screen and a LED on the breadboard just by tapping on buttons and sliding some sliders on the Blynk app. Thus, such a device could be used with some IoT applications via this kind of data transfer, which is limitless of distance and super fast. So there will be some new projects on my page based on esp8266. (Also, I am using the Adafruit's libraries for the 5110 screens.)
